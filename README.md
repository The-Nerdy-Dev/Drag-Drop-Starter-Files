# Drag-Drop-Starter-Files
In this video, we will learn about the lifecycle about the drag and drop event where we will perform the drag and drop operation on an image and move it from one location to one location. Real-world application of this feature can be found in Trello Board where you drag the pending tasks to the completion tab when they are completed.
